A placeholder for a local language.

Copy files from the default language folder (e.g. /en) here, and then translate them.

Also make sure that your language is added the the selection in "LANGS.md" file. For example, for French, we should add 

```* [French](fr)```

so it looks like this:

```* [English](en)```<br>
```* [French](fr)```
