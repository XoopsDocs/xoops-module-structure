# 8.0 Conventions Over Configuration {#_conventions_over_configuration}

We don't want you to waste time when you program, so we follow the principles of [Conventions Over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).

Following these rules will also make easier to maintain your code in the future by other developers. 

For example: 

* if you have a **User** model, then the corresponding table in the database should be named ```users``` by default.

* For files that are uploaded by users, each module should use the ```/uploads``` folder
