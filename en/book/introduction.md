## XOOPS Module Development

**Before write a module, start by some questions:**

**1\) Is there any similar module that will work for me?**   
If you can find a similar module maybe you can contribute in developing/ bug fixing that module instead of writing a module from scratch. for example there is a lot of content, gallery and download modules in XOOPS which you can use and develop more or customize for your needs. honestly i see no mean to write any more content module in XOOPS.

**2\) Is there any similar functionality in other modules which I could copy and use.**  
Maybe it seems odd but it will be good to announce in https://xoops.org forums about your future plans for a module and your needs. Please explain what you want to do. Usually there are some modules with similar functionality which you can use in your module.
